Extract state data from multiple files


###### Setting up rubahjs:

```js
const rubahjs = require("rubahjs");
```

We are importing rubahjs using standard require. By default the result returned are already instantiated and
ready to use. If you want to instantiate rubahjs manualy, you can use the constructor in ```new rubahjs.new(opts)```.
For more info on rubahjs constructor refer to [constructor manual](doc/compiled/constructor.md)
