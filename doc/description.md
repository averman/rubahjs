this project inspired by [plop js](https://plopjs.com/) and aims to bring project templating to a whole new level. 

Rubahjs manage all your data required for templating into a single state tree, and by single function call, you can create all templated file from that single state tree

More over, rubahjs also provide reverse templating (for simple [handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template) using [reversible handlebar](https://github.com/averman/reversible-handlebars). Using Rubahjs you can scan all the files in your project folder, and create a single state tree

Rubah is indonesian word for fox, and also have a different - non formal - meaning of **change**. Fox demon is also a mythical creature capable of shapeshifting in japanese folklore. Thus Rubahjs embrace the concept of change, and shapeshifting of data from one form into another
